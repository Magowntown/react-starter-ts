# React & Vite Practice Repository

This repository serves as a practice project for a class, focusing on React and Vite with TypeScript. It provides a starting point for learning and experimenting with these technologies, allowing students to gain hands-on experience in building TypeScript-based React applications with the help of Vite.

## Technologies Used

- React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Vite: A fast development build tool for modern web applications.
- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that enables static type-checking and improves developer productivity.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository:** Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-starter-ts.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:** Move into the project directory by running the following command:
   ```
   cd react-starter-ts
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:** Install the project dependencies using a package manager like npm or yarn. Run one of the following commands:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```
   yarn install
   ```

4. **Start the development server:** Launch the development server by executing the command below:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   or
   ```
   yarn dev
   ```

   This command will start the development server and provide you with a local URL where you can view and interact with the React application.
